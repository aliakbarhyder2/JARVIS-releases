## Download

**Latest release:** https://github.com/aliakbarhyder2/JARVIS-releases/releases/latest

Every release ships **four** artifacts — one per platform:

| Platform | File | How to install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows 10 / 11** | `JARVIS-Setup-<version>.exe` | Double-click, Next → Next → Install. Adds Start Menu shortcut, uninstallable from Add/Remove Programs. |
| **Windows** (portable) | `JARVIS.exe` | Bare app. No install — double-click to run. |
| **macOS 12+** | `JARVIS-<version>.dmg` | Open the DMG, drag `JARVIS.app` onto the `Applications` shortcut inside. |
| **Linux** (any distro) | `JARVIS-<version>.AppImage` | `chmod +x` the file and run it. Portable, no install, no root. |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** | `jarvis_<version>_amd64.deb` | `sudo dpkg -i jarvis_*.deb` — installs to `/opt/jarvis`, runnable as `jarvis`. |

Older builds are on the [releases page](https://github.com/aliakbarhyder2/JARVIS-releases/releases). You should always be on the latest — JARVIS auto-updates itself on Windows once installed (Mac/Linux auto-update is on the roadmap).

**System requirements:**
- Windows 10/11 · macOS 12+ · Linux with glibc 2.35+ (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 36+, Arch, etc.)
- 64-bit only
- ~500 MB free disk space
- Internet connection (for the Gemini Live API and updates)
- Microphone
- Google Gemini API key ([free from AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))

## First launch

1. Double-click `JARVIS.exe`
2. Paste your **licence code** (or drop your `.jarvis` file) — sent to you by email
3. Paste your **Gemini API key**
4. Say hello

That's it. JARVIS creates its config folder inside your user profile automatically — no admin rights, no manual setup.

---

## Auto-updates

Once installed, JARVIS silently checks this repository on every launch. When a newer release is published:

- JARVIS says *"Installing an update, sir. I'll be right back."*
- Downloads the new `JARVIS.exe`
- Swaps itself in place and restarts on the new version
- Your licence, API key, memory, and settings all carry over

To disable auto-updates, set `"auto_update": false` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JARVIS\config\api_keys.json`.
